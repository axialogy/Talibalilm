-- Policy tests for the site content tables.
--
-- Three separate claims, and each one is a different way to get it wrong:
--
--   * A DRAFT event or review is not public. The homepage filters on status in
--     its query, and a filter in a query is a convenience, not a gate — take
--     the filter out and the database must still refuse.
--   * `contact_messages` is insert-only for a stranger. Anyone may write to the
--     school; nobody may read back what anyone else wrote, or the table becomes
--     a list of who has contacted the institute and what about.
--   * `site_settings` is readable by everyone and writable by nobody but staff.
--     It is a banner and a footer, so the read is deliberately open — the thing
--     worth asserting is that an ordinary student cannot edit the banner on
--     every page of the site.
