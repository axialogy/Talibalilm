/**
 * Resolve the school's artwork HERE, at build time, and inline the answer.
 *
 * It used to be resolved by probing the filesystem at request time. That works
 * for a statically generated page, which is rendered during the build with
 * `public/` on disk — and silently fails inside a serverless function, where
 * Next does not ship `public/` because the CDN serves it. So the public site
 * (prerendered) showed the real lockup while the admin sidebar (rendered per
 * request) fell through to the drawn placeholder. Same code, different moment.
 *
 * Doing it in the config keeps the handover intact — drop a file in, redeploy —
 * without leaving a filesystem read on the request path.
