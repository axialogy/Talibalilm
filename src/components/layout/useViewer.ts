/**
 * Is anyone signed in, for the header only.
 *
 * Signed in, and nothing more. It used to read the profile's role as well, to
 * decide whether to show an Administration link — a decision made in the
 * browser, which is the wrong place for it. The dashboard carries that link
 * instead, chosen on the server, so a student's page never contains it.
 *
 * Read in the browser rather than on the server, and that is a deliberate
 * trade. The header sits in the root layout, so asking the server would mean
 * reading cookies there — which turns every marketing page dynamic and throws
 * away the static rendering the catalogue depends on for SEO. Chrome is not
 * worth that.
 *
 * Two reads, not one. `getSession()` answers from the stored cookie with no
 * network round trip, so the header flips to "Mon espace" the instant the
 * session exists — which is what a student who has just confirmed their email
 * expects. `getUser()` then revalidates against the auth server and corrects
 * the answer if the stored session was stale. The first is presentation, the
 * second is the truth, and the gap between them is a frame.
 *
 * The session can also change in a page we are not navigating: an email
 * confirmed in another tab, or a magic link opened in a second window. So the
 * read is repeated when the tab regains focus, when it becomes visible again,
 * and on every route change — otherwise the header keeps offering a login to
 * somebody who has already signed in.
 *
 * This is presentation only. Nothing here guards anything: the dashboard is
 * protected by the middleware and by the RLS policies, both of which hold
 * whatever this hook believes.
