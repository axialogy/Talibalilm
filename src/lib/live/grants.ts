/**
 * What one person may do inside a classroom, as LiveKit understands it.
 *
 * This is the security boundary of the room, so it is a pure function with
 * tests rather than an object built inline next to the token call.
 *
 * The important idea: these are not hints to the browser. LiveKit stamps them
 * into a signed token, and the media server enforces them. A student whose
 * grant carries no camera source cannot publish a camera — not because the
 * button is hidden, but because the SFU refuses the track. Hiding the button
 * is what we do so the page is not confusing; this is what makes it true.
 *
 * That distinction is the whole reason the room is being rebuilt. On the
 * embedded classroom every participant arrived with identical powers and the
 * teacher joined their own class as a student, because the public server would
 * not mint a token that said otherwise. Here we mint it ourselves.
